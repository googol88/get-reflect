  feedback: Despite there being a lot of similar extensions, reflect's detailing puts it on top of all of the other extensions I've used. reflect simplifies productivity and mindfulness in a world where accessibility is prioritized in clutter and distraction.

  feedback: reflect does everything you need without it being too confusing to pick up on your first go! It's simple and easy-to-understand UI makes it the perfect addition for anyone who wants to take that one extra second to mind themselves to be intentional about what they're doing!

  feedback: I love this extension! In my experiences with other extensions it has not been enough to simply block or "pause" websites that you are trying to refrain from to increase productivity. Having to justify the reason why you are visiting a site is enough to help me snap back to doing productive work.

  feedback: I'm super impressed with the elegance and simplicity of reflect. It really goes beyond what most other website blockers do by making you stop and think about why you actually need to click on that link. I've seen my productivity improve greatly as a result of using this and I can't recommend it highly enough!
